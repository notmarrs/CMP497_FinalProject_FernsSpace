# Object Detection & Obstacle Avoidance Module

This folder contains Fernanda's section of the final project: **Object Detection and Obstacle Avoidance** using Raspberry Pi.

These scripts handle:
- Ultrasonic sensor testing and integration
- Simple obstacle detection logic
- Real-time communication between robot and controller
- Command handling (pause/stop/status)
- Stress testing obstacle detection under dynamic conditions

## Folder Structure

- `ultrasonic_testing/` – Tests the ultrasonic sensor for distance measurement
- `obstacle_avoidance/` – Contains detection logic and basic unit test
- `communication/` – Handles Wi-Fi communication and command parsing
- `system_testing/` – Simulates obstacle scenarios for stress testing

## Notes

- ⚠️ GPIO pin numbers and port numbers are **placeholders** – confirm them on the actual setup.
- All logs are output using Python's built-in `logging` module.

## Integration

TBD
